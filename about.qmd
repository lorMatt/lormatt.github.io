# About me

I have a background in policy and economics, and am now a PhD candidate in Economic Sociology, Organisation, and Labour (ESOL) at the University of Milan. I am also involved in cultural and social organisations, such as *Ippogogo APS* or *RxR - una Regione per Restare*.

My research interests lie at the crossroads between social stratification and public discourse. Due to my mixed background, I can count on both solid foundations in data analysis and extensive domain knowledge in social sciences.

This site will also accommodate some of my less "serious" work, as well as some teaching material.
