I am a PhD candidate in Economic Sociology, Organisation, and Labour at the University of Milan. My main research interests revolve around the effects of local development trajectories and economic inequality on public opinion formation. On this website, you will find a selection of my data analysis projects (both the serious and the *unserious*) as well as tutorials and teaching material. Check out the [about](about.qmd) section to get to know me better.
