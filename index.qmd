I am a Master student in Politics and Social Policy at the University of Bologna. My main research interests revolve around social stratification and economic inequality. On this website, you will find a selection of my data analysis projects (both the serious and the *unserious*) as well as some data literacy teaching material. Check out the [about](about.qmd) section to get to know me better.
